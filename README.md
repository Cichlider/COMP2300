# COMP2300 - Computer Architecture (2026 S1)

This repository is for my COMP2300 course materials and assignments. 

## ⚖️ Course Policies (TL;DR)

### 1. Submission & Marking
* **Official Submission:** Only the code pushed to the **ANU GitLab server** counts.
* **The "Final" Rule:** The last commit on the `main` branch before the deadline is what gets marked.
* **CI/CD:** Pay attention to GitLab CI emails. A "failed pipeline" usually means a missing Statement of Originality or formatting issue.
* **Language:** All code must be written in the language specified (Digital Logic or ARM Assembly). No exceptions.

### 2. Academic Integrity
* **Statement of Originality (SoO):** Every assignment MUST include a signed `statement-of-originality.md`.
* **Citations:** If I use code from StackOverflow or discuss strategies with classmates, it **must** be documented in the SoO.
* **Plagiarism:** All submissions are run through plagiarism detection software.

### 3. Lab & Help
* **Labs:** Attendance is crucial as assessments build on lab work.
* **Forum:** Use the course forum (Ed) for troubleshooting and questions. Do not post full assignment code publicly.
* **Feedback:** Marks and feedback are released via a dedicated feedback branch in the GitLab repo.
