ISA vs. Microarchitecture
§ ISA: Specification of a set of definite instructions that the computer
can carry out
§ All computers (CPUs/microprocessors) perform the same set of
basic instructions
§ ADD, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE, MOVE, BRANCH
§ Two manufacturers might differ in which set of basic instructions
§ Microarchitecture: Implementation of the ISA using circuits
41

===== PAGE 43 =====
ISA vs. Microarchitecture
§ ISA: What the driver needs to know as he sits
inside the automobile to make the automobile
carry out the driver’s wishes
§ If the middle pedal (brake) is pressed, the car
stops
§ Steering wheel, ignition key, the gears,
windshield wipers
§ Microarchitecture: What goes underneath the
hood
§ Different cost/performance tradeoffs
§ Some are turbocharged. Some have disc
brakes. Some cost a million $. Some are more
fuel efficient than others 42

Two Recurring Themes
§ The notion of abstraction
§ Hardware + software = computer system
62

===== PAGE 64 =====
The Notion of Abstraction
§ Abstraction: Know components from a high level of detail
No human (programmer) can track
10 billion elements. Computer systems
work because of abstraction!
Apple M1 Chip
Billions of transistors
All working in parallel

The Notion of Abstraction
§ Abstraction: View the world from a higher level
§ Focus on the important aspects
§ It is a way to enhance productivity and efficiency
64

===== PAGE 66 =====
The Notion of Abstraction
§ We will raise the level of abstraction in this course
every couple weeks
§ We start from the ground (up) because this is how
computers have evolved
§ Each layer in the transformation hierarchy is an
abstraction layer

important one

A Canonical Computer System
§ Most computer systems can be viewed as below
§ Key resources: CPU, memory, I/O devices, storage
§ CPU (processor/microprocessor) does the actual computation
§ Processor can access memory much faster than storage
I/O Peripherals
Main Memory
Storage
75

===== PAGE 77 =====
Idea 1: Key components are same
§ Key Idea 1: All computer systems, big or small, have a few
fundamental components
§ Microprocessor (processor or central processing unit or
CPU) for doing computation
§ Main memory for storing temporary information and
program data close to the processor
§ Storage devices (disks or SSDs) for storing long-term or
persistent information
§ I/O devices to communicate with the external environment
§ Sensors
§ Peripherals
76

===== PAGE 78 =====
Idea 2: They all can solve the same
problems
§ Key Idea 2: All computers regardless of size, cost, and speed
can compute the same things if they are given enough time
and memory
§ Anything a fast computer can do, a slow computer can do
77

===== PAGE 79 =====
Computer = Universal Computational Device
§ Anything that can be computed, can be computed by a
computer provided it has enough time and enough memory
§ We instruct the computer how to do X, and it obliges by
interpreting our instructions
§ Instructions are stored in memory like regular data
§ Computer is programmable because we can rewrite
instructions to make it do something else
78

===== PAGE 80 =====
Computer = Universal Computational Device
§ The idea of a universal computational device is due
to Alan Turing (1937)
§ He gave the mathematical description of the Turing
machine
§ A particular kind of machine called the Turing
machine can carry out all computations
79

===== PAGE 81 =====
Computer = Universal Computational Device
§ First, we have two simple example Turing machines
§ One for addition, and one for multiplication
§ What we now call a computer is a Turing machine that can
simulate all Turing machines
§ What does it need as inputs?
§ Inputs and the description of the Turing machine to simulate
§ We say that Turing machines are programmable
§ Hence, computers are programmable

Some Comments from Previous Years
§ Genuinely the best course I have taken yet - the content was
really well structured, eg. the transition from circuits to then
assembly coding just made so much sense. There was a real
sense of satisfaction at the end of assignment 1, looking at
how I could understand every individual part of the CPU we
built. The lectures expanded on the knowledge that was
taught in labs, which helped to solidify the concepts. Also, I
liked how the assignments built upon the labs, as it gave a lot
of incentive to stay on top of course work. The content is fun
too, looking forward to comp2310.

Some Comments from Previous Years
§ How the course starts from scratch and progressively
abstracts and builds upon concepts to build strong intuition in
complex topics. The high quality of explanations in lectures,
and the support from tutors and the course conveners on Ed
and in labs. The assignment tasks were awesome, especially
for the opportunity they provided to take on extension tasks.
the exam was excellently designed. Everything about this
course is great.

Some Comments from Previous Years
§ This is easily the best, most interesting and well-structured
course I have done in the two years I've spent at ANU. I
definitely have learnt a lot about computers and how they
execute programs under the hood. The assignments were
quite interesting and I particularly enjoyed making my own
CPU and building a snake game on the microbit. I couldn't
emphasise any more about how great this course was in my
experience, Shoaib was great he often swiftly replied on ed
and emails and seemed to actually care about student
wellbeing and how students were interpreting the course
material.

Some Comments from Previous Years
§ Out of my many years at ANU, this course is definitely in my
top 3 favourite courses. The content was taught in a well
thought out manner that structurally built upon itself at a
reasonable pace. Additionally, the content was taught in an
engaging manner, I particularly liked how the assignments
were done. Shoaib's explanations in the lectures where really
good, he took an appropriate amount of time explaining
concepts and even explained the same concept in different
styles which greatly helped with my understanding of a
complicated topic.

Representing Information: Analog
§ Measuring things and storing data by analogy has been
the predominant approach in history
§ Analog signals are called analog because they are
directly proportional to the original information they
represent (and can take an infinite # values)
§ The term analog comes from the Greek word
"analogos" which means "proportional"
118

===== PAGE 120 =====
Problem with Analog Approach
§ Using continuous variables to represent information
is hard for the computer to deal with
§ Sometimes difficult to measure precisely
§ Difficult to store
§ Difficult to copy
119

===== PAGE 121 =====
This Course Uses Digital Approach
§ If we don’t want to represent data as something
with potentially infinitely varying analog values,
what can we do?
§ Use the Digital approach
§ Represent information using discrete steps rather
than continuous variation
120

This Course Uses Digital Approach
§ Digital Systems represent information
with discrete-valued variables
§ Discrete variables can have a finite
number of distinct values

§ Charles Babbage’s analytical engine used ten
discrete values
§ Used mechanical parts such as gears with ten

representation

worrying about the physical realization of such variables

Binary Codes
§ Suppose we want to represent 4 colors: {red, blue, green, black}
§ How many bits of information do I need?
§ (00, 01, 10, 11)
§ The assignment of the 2-bit binary code to colors is ad-hoc
§ Also legitimate is: (10, 11, 00, 01)
§ How many bits of information do we need to represent the
alphabet set in English?
§ For 26 alphabets, we need 5 bits
